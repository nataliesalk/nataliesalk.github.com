My lab is fully functional. 
If you are using a any computer screen with a minimum pixel width of 1024 it will say "No Dice" on the screen.
If you are using a iPhone 4 in landscape or vertical orientation it will 
say "Dice" on the screeen. 

I worked with Stefan Lenoach on this lab. 

This lab took me two hours to complete.
